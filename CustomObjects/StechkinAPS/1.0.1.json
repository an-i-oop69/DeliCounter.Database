  "Name": "\"Stechkin\" APS",
  "VersionNumber": "1.0.1",
  "Description": "\"I just want to be less of a burden...\"\r\n\r\nIntended for vehicle crews and artillerymen, this Russian machinepistol is surprisingly practical in game- using both hands, it can be fired on full auto with good accuracy, and the wire stock and suppressor turn it into quite a handy little PDW. Comes with a 20 round magazine. The only thing holding it back is the lack of AP ammo in 9x18 in game. \r\n\r\nDue to code limitations on the game's handgun script, I am unable to get the proper three position selector\/decocker and SA\/DA operation (somehow broken on full auto pistols)- therefore, the weapon only has semi and full selector positions and is single action. Doesn't change much gameplay wise, just an inaccuracy. \r\n\r\nThe weapon can be found at the end of the Machine pistols category, and the wire stock and suppressor under their respective attachment category. Have fun!",
