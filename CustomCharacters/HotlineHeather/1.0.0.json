There's some time sensitive data on there I need by ANY means necessary. ...Oh and as always, be discrete.'\r\n\r\nIn Hotline Heather you step into a drug fueled sosig killing spree of unclear motive! In this 80's action inspired Take and Hold you'll be using a limited arsenal of only weapons featured in the hit series Hotline Miami! Face down mob goons, SWAT cops, and god knows what else!\r\n\r\nThis character is designed with Limited Ammo in mind as enemies will drop magazines corresponding with the gun they use to recreate the feeling of scrambling for a weapon in the original games!
